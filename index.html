    <p>Aquaponics is a sustainable way of recreating a circular system in which uses the aquaculture of fishes. The fish culture produce waste that feeds the growth of plants. The are also Aeroponics systems which are complex systems that feeds plants through mists of water. Biomimicry is a good standard to design any aeroponic, hydroponic and aquaponic system as it reflects upon the circular systems of nature instead of only extracting resources from nature without any return. The most important way of feeding the plants in a hydroponic system is to fill the water with NPK, depending on the kind of plant and its different stages a different quantity of the chemicals will be needed. Every system should be mesured for its nutrients levels through an EC number.There is great importance in the Ph of the water that is being used as plants can only use nutrients at certain PH. Nutrient deficiency can be a result of poor oxygination, incorrect ph level, excess of nutrient and insufficient amount of other nutrients. Hydroponics and Aquaponics should through regular routine checks to search for : leaks, clogs, equipment failure and pathogens. Electrical appliances should be distant from water as their encounter can cause a shock or fire harzard.</p>

    <p> HTML is used for the text and content of a website while CSS deals with the styling of it. Github is a great platform to share codes and work in groups on codes. Through branches, different programmers can work on a code without affecting each others work. A responsive design is used to react according to the user's device and platform. It uses Media Queries, Bootstrap, Flexbox and Grid to optimize the user experience in different devices. Bootstrap is an excellent resource to web development as it is an open source front end framework to help create responsive design. Javascript is the brains of the code, it can offer variable definitions and functions that can create certain outputs that make the code interactive. Javascript can also analyse a lot of the data contained inside the code. With the code var it is possible to store a lot of data values. JavaScript has primitive data values that have no additional properties and methods, such as numbers, strings and booleans. Methods are used to acquire more information about data. </p>

    <h1 class="title">Construction</h1>
    <p>Between the most essential tools used for construction there are two types: the hand tools and power tools. Between the hand tools there are the back saw, the rib saw, claw hammer, and pry bars. When sawing wood, the saw and body should be put at a 45 degree angle. When nailing or placing a screw into wood, the strenght and width of it should be observed so it wont be broken in half. </p>

    <h1 class="title">Hands-on</h1>
    <p>As reccomended by our instructors before repotting any plant it is reccomended to put a bit of water inside the hole the plant will be fixed. This is important to not let the plants move or sink when they are first watered after repotting. While repotting it is easy to kill a plant, the shock should be minimized but the soil should be gently separated so air can come in and the plant can absorb more nutrients after repotting. </p>
